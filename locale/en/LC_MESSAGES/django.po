"<h3>What is TEDxNTUA?</h3><p>TEDxNTUA is a conference that features "
"<strong>talks</strong> on the topics of <strong>popular science</strong>, "
"<strong>art</strong>, and <strong>social issues</strong>, <strong>stories "
"that can inspire</strong>, as well as <strong>intriguing workshops</strong> "
"and <strong>performances</strong>. It runs under the auspices of the "
"National Technical University of Athens, Greece (<a href=\"https://www.ntua."
"gr\" target=\"_blank\">NTUA</a>) and is primarily aimed at the university "
"community, but also at the wider student and local communities of Athens.</"
"p><p>Our organizing team consists of <strong>volunteer students</strong>, "
"mainly of NTUA, who embrace the notion of spreading worthy ideas, as "
"conceived by the TED organization. Our aspiration as a team is to build this "
"event into a platform where people who can make a difference will have their "
"voices heard; where community members can engage with one another and spark "
"fruitful discussion about our common concerns, like <strong>engineering</"
"strong> and its role in building <strong>a better and more inclusive "
"society</strong>.</p><p>Since the project’s inception in <strong>2015</"
"strong>, the members of the student community have consistently shown their "
"support with their participation as attendees or volunteers. They have thus "
"helped establish it as an institution and imbued us with a sense of duty "
"towards them. A crucial part in achieving this, is our constant effort to "
"make the event <strong>open for everyone</strong>, by charging no attendance "
"fee, with the help of our partners.</p><p>TEDxNTUA has a <strong>non-profit</"
"strong> motive and is solely funded by sponsor companies, organizations and "
"patrons. It is supervised by NTUA professors and formally belongs to the "
"Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (<a href=\"https://www.iccs."
"gr\" target=\"_blank\">ICCS</a>) of NTUA.</p>"
